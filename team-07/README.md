## Description
Establishing	a	database	that	links	poison	centers	with	hospitals,	enriched	with	AI	capabilities,	offers	a	comprehensive	
solution.	This	system's	functionalities	can	be	outlined	as	follows:
1.	Antidote	Stock	Management:
- The	AI	database	continually	monitors	antidote	stocks	within	hospitals.
- Upon	detecting	shortages,	it	promptly	alerts	the	hospital	and	the	antidote	distributor.
2.	Emergency	Call	Analysis:
In	the	event	of	an	emergency	call,	the	AI	operates	in	the	background	to	perform	the	following	tasks:
1.	Identifies	the	specific	toxin	involved.
2.	Dispatches	the	appropriate	management	document	to	the	hospital,	assisting	medical	professionals	in	delivering	
timely	and	precise	care.
3.	Verifies	the	availability	of	the	required	antidote	at	the	current	hospital.	If	unavailable:
- The	AI	searches	for	the	nearest	hospital	equipped	with	the	antidote.
- It	confirms	antidote	availability	through	an	AI-initiated	call.
- Notifies	the	hospital	that	a	patient	transfer	is	required	from	another	facility,	ensuring	swift	treatment.
3.	Data	Archiving	for	Research:
The	system	retains	all	data	for	research	purposes,	facilitating	in-depth	investigations	into	poison-related	matters	and	
contributing	to	advancements	in	medical	science.
