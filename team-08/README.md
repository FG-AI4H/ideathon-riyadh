## Topic
Automated Diagnosis of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) using Machine Learning on ECG Data

## Description
Our team aims to develop a machine learning model using PyTorch to accurately diagnose HCM from 12-lead ECG image data. The model will also estimate the severity of the condition and predict the likelihood of complications. We have access to a large dataset of ECGs and are collaborating with a cardiologist for domain-specific expertise. The model will eventually be integrated into a larger SaaS application and deployed on Azure.
