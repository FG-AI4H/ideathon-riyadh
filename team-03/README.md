## Description
Our innovative drug dispensary device
combines a mobile application and a physical device. It is a
solution designed to address two critical healthcare
challenges: assisting patients with suicidal ideation and
providing controlled access to narcotic drugs for individuals
at risk of addiction.The device provides tailored medication
dosages for patients with suicidal ideation, stabilizing their
mental health and reducing self-harm risk.
Each device has a unique barcode that patients can safely
scan using the app. The app provides essential information
such as the drug name, dosage, frequency, and the time of
the next dose. It notifies the patient of missed doses,
updates to the physician, and tracks compliance rates.
If a taper-up medication is prescribed and a patient misses
a day, the device automatically restarts the dosage as
instructed by the psychiatrist. Our device prioritizes patient
safety, privacy, and effective communication with healthcare providers.
