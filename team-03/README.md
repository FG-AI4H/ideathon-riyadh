## Description
Our AI software is called "Addiction Guardian" seamlessly integrates with existing camera systems 
to detect behavioral and facial expressions of addiction. 
It will be trained on analyzing a database of addicts and normal individuals,
by benchmarking normal individuals to assess normality, 
as well as, benchmarking the specific individuals to assess their behaviour changes,
then alerting responsible parties in organizations about suspected addiction behavior. 
This versatile software has applications in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, prisons, and schools.
Additionally, consumers can integrate it into their home camera systems
to monitor addiction and relapse signs of their loved ones.
Our plan involves implementing the software, utilizing personalized data for individualized recovery plans,
and expanding its capabilities to detect suicidal signs and patterns.
