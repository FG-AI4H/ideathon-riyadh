Our AI program is called "Addimemory" and it seamlessly integrates with cameras and mics in addiction clinics 
to detect behaviorious, facial expressions, body language and voice changes in each session 
and actively differentiating the data obtained from each session 
assisting the psychiatrist in tracking the patientâ€™s progress. 
by benchmarking the patients to assess their behavioral changes and monitor addiction and relapse signs.
