AI detection of allergy patch test

## Description
Introducing the AI Allergy Patch Detection System, addressing the pressing issue of costly and time-consuming traditional allergy testing. With expenses reaching $200 per person, primarily due to clinic visits, this system aims to revolutionize the process. Our solution involves a generative AI technology that provides instructions and analyzes patch results through simple photographs, significantly improving the patient experience by saving time and reducing costs. To implement this groundbreaking idea, securing FDA approval opens the door to widespread adoption. We plan to distribute these tests through established pharmacies like Al Nahdi and Al Dawaa, offering easy accessibility to customers, eliminating the immediate need for a doctor's visit, and potentially creating a substantial market opportunity for companies. This innovation is set to transform allergy testing and make it more affordable and convenient for everyone.
